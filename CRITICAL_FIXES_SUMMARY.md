# Critical Fixes Summary - October 15, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. TeamStatsModal Navigation Buttons Fixed
**Problem**: "View Full Stats" and "Player Props" buttons were only logging actions instead of navigating
**Solution**: 
- Added proper navigation callbacks in `SimpleGamesTab.tsx`
- "View Full Stats" now navigates to AI Insights tab
- "Player Props" now navigates to Player Props tab
- Uses `useWidgetStore.getState().setSelectedTab()` for navigation

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/widget/tabs/SimpleGamesTab.tsx`

### 2. Player Props Loading Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Player props were not loading due to undefined function calls
**Solution**:
- Fixed undefined `getPlayerHeadshotUrl` and `getTeamLogoUrl` function calls
- Properly imported and used existing functions from `gameDataHelper.ts`
- Added proper fallback handling for failed image loads

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/widget/tabs/NovaTitanElitePlayerPropsTab.tsx`

**Technical Details:**
- Changed local function definitions to use imported `getPlayerHeadshot` and `getTeamLogo`
- Fixed function naming consistency throughout the component
- Added SVG fallback generation for failed image loads

### 3. AI Predictions Display Fixed
**Problem**: AI predictions showing generic "AI analysis available" message instead of detailed analysis
**Solution**:
- Fixed analysis rendering to properly display structured analysis object
- Added comprehensive display of key factors, trends, risk/value indicators, weather, and injuries
- Enhanced visual presentation with color-coded badges and structured layout

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/widget/tabs/SimplePredictionsTab.tsx`

**Technical Details:**
- Changed from checking `typeof prediction.analysis === 'string'` to properly accessing object properties
- Added individual rendering for:
  - `keyFactors` array
  - `trends` array  
  - `value` and `riskLevel` with color-coded badges
  - `weather` conditions
  - `injuries` list

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Navigation System
- Uses Zustand store (`useWidgetStore`) for state management
