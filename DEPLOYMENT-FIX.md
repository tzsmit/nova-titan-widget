# 🚀 Nova Titan Widget - Deployment Issues Fixed

## ✅ Issues Identified and Resolved:

### 1. **GitHub Actions Configuration Fixed**
- ❌ **Problem**: Workflow was trying to use `npm ci` with missing package-lock.json
- ❌ **Problem**: Cache configuration was looking for non-existent lock file
- ✅ **Fixed**: Updated workflow to use `npm install` instead
- ✅ **Fixed**: Removed cache dependency that was causing failures

### 2. **Vite Configuration Fixed**  
- ❌ **Problem**: Vite config was using `terser` minification without the dependency
- ❌ **Problem**: Complex rollup configuration was causing build issues
- ✅ **Fixed**: Switched to `esbuild` minification (built into Vite)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Simplified build configuration for reliability

### 3. **Build Process Optimized**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Proper base path configuration for GitHub Pages (`base: './'`)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Asset naming with proper hashing for caching
